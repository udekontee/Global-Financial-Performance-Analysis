# 🪙 Global Financial Performance Analysis
**ETL, KPI computation, and financial visualization using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)**  

---

## 📘 Project Overview  
This project examines a global financial dataset to reveal **sales performance, profit margins, and market insights** across various business segments and countries.  
Using **Python in Jupyter Notebook**, the data was cleaned, transformed, and visualized to identify where the company’s strongest revenue streams lie — and which areas require cost optimization.  

The analysis simulates a real-world executive financial report, helping decision-makers pinpoint trends, assess profitability, and optimize the strategic allocation of resources.  

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives  
- Perform **ETL (Extract-Transform-Load)** operations on raw Excel data.  
- Compute and visualize **core financial KPIs** — total sales, profit, COGS, and profit margin.  
- Identify **top-performing countries, segments, and products** based on sales and profit.  
- Analyze **monthly trends** to uncover seasonality and demand cycles.  
- Create an **executive-style dashboard** in Python with clear, data-driven visuals.

## 📊 Data Processing & Workflow  
1. **Data Import & Cleaning**  
   - Imported Excel dataset into Pandas.  
   - Cleaned column names, standardized data types, and handled null values.  
   - Extracted `month`, `year`, and `month_year` for time-series analysis.  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Generated descriptive statistics using `df.describe()`.  
   - Verified integrity via `df.info()` and `df.nunique()`.  
   - Computed KPIs like profit margin and total units sold.  

3. **Visualization Development**  
   Designed 4 polished charts aligned with the **gold-and-black Power BI theme** used in the *Executive Investment Dashboard*:  
   - **Sales & Profit by Segment**  
   - **Top 10 Countries by Sales & Profit**  
   - **Monthly Sales & Profit Trend**  
   - **Top 10 Most Profitable Products**  

4. **Insight Export**  
   - Cleaned dataset exported as `clean_financial_project_sample.csv`.  
   - Visuals saved in `/images/` for GitHub portfolio integration.

## 💡 Key Findings  
- 🏛 **Government and Small Business segments** generated the highest total sales globally.  
- 🌍 **France, Germany, and Mexico** were among the top-performing countries in both sales and profit.  
- 📆 **Seasonality:** Sales peaked around mid-year (June–September), suggesting cyclical buying behavior.  
- 💰 **Profit Margin:** Averaged around **14 %**, indicating stable operational efficiency.  
- 📈 **Cost-to-Sales correlation** confirmed efficient production management — higher sales didn’t significantly inflate costs.
